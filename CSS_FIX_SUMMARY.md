# CSS Loading Issue Fixed ✅

## Issue Identified
The console error `Failed to load resource: /_next/static/css:1 404` was caused by:
1. **Duplicate CSS files** in both `app/globals.css` and `styles/globals.css`
2. **Missing autoprefixer** in PostCSS configuration
3. **CSS path conflicts** during build process

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Removed Duplicate CSS Files
- ❌ Deleted `styles/globals.css` (duplicate)
- ❌ Deleted `styles/critical.css` (conflicting styles)
- ✅ Kept `app/globals.css` as the single source of truth

### 2. Updated PostCSS Configuration
- ✅ Added `autoprefixer` to `postcss.config.mjs`
- ✅ Ensured proper CSS processing pipeline

### 3. Clean Build Process
- ✅ Cleared Next.js cache (`.next` directory)
- ✅ Rebuilt with clean state
- ✅ Verified production build success

## Current State
- ✅ Build completes without errors
- ✅ Production server runs successfully
- ✅ CSS loads properly in both development and production
- ✅ All Tailwind styles and custom CSS working correctly
- ✅ No 404 errors for CSS resources

## CSS Architecture
```
app/
├── globals.css          ← Single source of CSS truth
└── layout.tsx          ← Imports ./globals.css

postcss.config.mjs      ← Processes CSS with Tailwind + Autoprefixer
tailwind.config.ts      ← Tailwind configuration
```

## Performance Impact
- **Bundle size**: Optimized CSS delivery
- **Loading time**: Eliminated duplicate CSS downloads
- **Build time**: Faster builds without conflicting files
- **SEO**: Proper CSS loading improves rendering performance

The CSS loading issue has been completely resolved! 🎉
